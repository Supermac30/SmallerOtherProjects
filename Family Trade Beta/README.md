# Family Trade
This holds a project I worked on to learn how to create a password system in python. It could be greatly improved
by not storing the passwords and logins in a text file and by salting the hashes.

# Functionality to be added
- The server and client files are currently empty. I will later add online functionality to this code as practice.
- I have wanted to learn how to implement a blockchain in my code for a while, this could be the perfect place to learn.

Will come back to this project soon.
