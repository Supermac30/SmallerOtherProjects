# Gradius++

This is a game I made to learn javascript.

Using the p5 library I made a scrolling shooter. The p5 library is included in this directory, it is taken from https://p5js.org/download/.

It uses the music from the nes-era game Gradius.

To play download this directory and run the HTML file in your browser.

## controls
Press WASD for movement and space to shoot. R is to restart.
